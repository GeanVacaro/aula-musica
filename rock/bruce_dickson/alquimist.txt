Wash away the blackness with the silver rain
Don't turn away - don't turn away
Wash away the blackness with the silver rain
Don't turn away - don't try to hide

Sulphurous and burning, spitting out the sun
The beginning of creation, of the golden one
A window to the west, a blazing star above
In taurus we begin it and the ladder has begun

Don't try and blame me for your sins
For the sun has burned me black
You're hollow lives, this world in wich we live
I throw it back

Four headed dragon for the four degrees of fire
Purify the insane, bring the solution ever higher
Bring me all the elements, spread them round my head
Bring me mad men's bodies, I will break them all like bread

Don't try and blame me for your sins
For the sun has burned me black
You're hollow lives, this world in wich we live
I hurl it back

Don't try and blame me for your sins
For the sun has burned me black
You're hollow lives, this world in wich we live
I throw it back
