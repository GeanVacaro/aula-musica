When I was younger I thought, that to kill
Or be killed was a thing to be proud of
Victim of chance, prisoner of hope
Hanged by the neck on the end of the rope
I don't know, I don't care

Oh, one of the damned, oh, part of the plan

Cry-oh-oh-oh, the gods of war
They howl and cry for more
Cry-oh-oh-oh, the gods of war
They howl and cry for more

Now taking both sides at a time on the front line
You can join in the fear, share in the bloodshed
Investing your money in guns, the infinite fun
Of the warlord you saved, from a rusty grave

Oh, one of the damned, oh, part of the plan

Cry-oh-oh-oh, the gods of war
They howl and cry for more
Cry-oh-oh-oh, the gods of war
They howl and cry for more

Cry-oh-oh-oh, the gods of war
They howl and cry for more
Cry-oh-oh-oh, the gods of war
They howl and cry for more
