I called a cab while you got drunk
Wanna leave this town before it tears me up
Coulnd't find what you were looking for
Now you're running out to the dancing floor
But you still call me after closing time
Say you accidentally pressed my name again

Won't you slow down, darlin?
If you fly too fast you might not see the edge
Take the road up the mountain
Cause you won't find truth or peace of mind in a barroom
But you find fake love in a strangers arms
After dark

I remember when you first loved me
And the smile you gave from the passenger seat
Did the fire in your eyes burn out?
I thought you'd be better off by now
But you still call me on some lonely nights
Say you accidentally pressed my name again

Won't you slow down, darlin?
If you fly too fast you might not see the edge
Take the road up the mountain
Cause you won't find truth or peace of mind in a barroom
But you find fake love in a strangers arms
After dark

I found some rest in smaller towns
Where the love runs deep and the grass grows wild did you find what you were looking for?
Cause I found myself on a mountain lake
Shore
