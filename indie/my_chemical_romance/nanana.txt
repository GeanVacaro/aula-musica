Doctor Death Defying]
The future is bulletproof
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys, make some noise

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Drugs, gimme drugs, gimme drugs
I don't need it, but I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it, eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, kill 'em all
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator

Love, gimme love, gimme love
I don't need it, but I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag in a box, put an X on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me

(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) from mall security
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) to every enemy
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) we're on your property
Standing in V-formation
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) let's blow an artery
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) eat plastic surgery
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) keep your apology
Give us more detonation

More, gimme more, gimme more

Oh, let me tell you 'bout the sad man
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a madman?
Thought you was Batman (na-na)
And hit the party with a gas can
Kiss me, you animal

(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) you run the company
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) fuck like a Kennedy
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) I think we'd rather be
Burning your information
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) let's blow an artery
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) eat plastic surgery
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) keep your apology
Give us more detonation

And right here, right now, all the way in Battery City
The little children raise their open, filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to Heaven
And all the juvee halls and the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon and fuckin' garbage
Scream out: What will save us?
And the sky opened up

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one
No one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try now
I'll be your detonator

(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) make no apology
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) it's death or victory
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) on my authority
Crash and burning, young and loaded
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) drop like a bullet shell
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) dress like a sleeper cell
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na) I'd rather go to Hell

Than be in purgatory
Cut my hair, gag and bore me
Pull this pin, let this world explode
